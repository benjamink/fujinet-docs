# Using CONFIG

CONFIG is the main interface FujiNet provides to navigate storage hosts (eg, network shares) & mount media to the virtual "disk slots" the FujiNet uses to emulate attached storage on your platform.  Each platform has unique ways of using storage & the pages that follow will provide instructions on how to enter & navigate the CONFIG interface to connect storage as desired.
